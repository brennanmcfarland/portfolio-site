A deep learning library I built on top of PyTorch.  It includes commonly needed features like training loops, metrics, memory optimization, and GPU-accelerated data loading.  I wanted maximum flexibility when using this in my own projects (which I have), so every piece can either be used in conjunction with the others or alongside the underlying framework.  To achieve this, I wrote it in a more functional programming style than you'd normally find in some of my other projects or in the Python community.  Also naming is hard.
