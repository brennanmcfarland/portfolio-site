A digital voice assistant and accessibility tool built on the Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services Platform.  Cardinal listens for spoken commands via microphone, then uses the platform to translate that sound to text, semantically match that text to a command to execute, and return the result via text to speech.  You can use it to get the time, the news, the weather, or info from Wikipedia (definitely the most fun to play with).
